# Quickdraw
A simple implementation of the [Google Quickdraw Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). Run `main.py` and draw. Press space to get a prediction and right click to reset.

## The Process
Using a subset of a subset of the 50 million drawings, I trained a convolutional neural network to recognize all 345 classes (It's not great at it though).

## Why?
I wanted to learn how to use tensorflow and keras, and I thought this would be a fun way to do it. I've been kinda absent from Github for a little bit and thought this was a fun little experiment to show why.
